bzip2 is required only on Apple platforms.

bzip2-1.0.8-use-env.tar.gz is bzip2-1.0.8.tar.gz, slightly modified to get the compiler name, etc. from environment variables, so that it can work on ios. This is configured in the Makefile of the bzip2 library.

portaudio and glfw are not used on mobile platforms, where sound and windowing facilities are referenced directly by small3d.

glew is also not used on mobile platforms, on which small3d only runs on Vulkan.

In zlib-1.2.11-noexample.tar.gz, the part of the standard zlib CMakeLists.txt file that configures the builds of some example binaries has been deleted, because it was failing on the small3d ios build.

zlib-1.2.11-noexample.tar.gz is not used for Android builds, where zlib is referenced from the platform infrastructure.
