Build small3d for android. Then copy:

  small3d/build/include to islet-hell/android/app/deps/include
  small3d/build/lib to islet-hell/android/app/deps/lib
  small3d/build/shaders to islet-hell/android/app/src/main/assets/resources/shaders

Some phones using the Qualcomm Adreno GPU cannot compile the vertex shader. Strangely enough the solution is to
download the chronos validation layers binaries from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/releases
and deploy them with the Android application. I am using the latest validation layers (v1.3.224 at the time of
writing - the v1.2 layers make the virtual devices in Android Studio crash).
In order to deploy them, decompress the archive and copy the directories it contains (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, etc) to
islet-hell/android/app/src/main/jniLibs. (Already done for Islet Hell and checked-in to Git.)
More recently, another failure to compile the vertex shader on a device with an Adreno GPU was resolved by removing the joints calculations
from the shader in small3d (only for Android devices). The validation layer is still necessary though, since there are crashes if it is removed, even with
the joints calculations removed.
