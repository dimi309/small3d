Android Tests for small3d
-------------------------

For this project to work, run the scripts/build-android script first.

Everything works fine with OpenGL ES.

When using Vulkan, gltf (glb) joints animation does not work on Android
because the shader would crash on Adreno gpus when containing joint
calculations. A separate shader without this code was created in order to
avoid this problem (perspectiveMatrixLightedShaderNoJoints.vert)

Even with this hack, on Vulkan the shaders fail to load on some devices with
Adreno gpus. Another hack to avoid that issue, is to download the latest
Khronos validation layer binaries from
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers
and place the jniLibs directory in small3d\android\app\src\main.
small3d has been programmed to load them, even in release builds,
because for some strange reason this corrects the shader load issue
most of the time.

*** In order to build small3d and the tests for Vulkan, the android platform
    version has to be set to at least 26 in scripts/build-android.bat (or .sh,
    variable platformstr) and in android/app/build.gradle (minSdk).

*** For OpenGL ES builds targetting older devices you will probably need to build
    with an older version of the Android NDK, like 22.1.7171670 because otherwise
    there can be errors like this one on some of them:
    Cannot load library: soinfo_relocate(linker.cpp:975): cannot locate symbol
    "statvfs" referenced by "libc++_shared.so"...
