Android Tests for small3d
-------------------------

For this project to work, run the scripts/build-android script first.

Everything works fine with OpenGL ES.

When using Vulkan, gltf (glb) joints animation does not work on Android
because the shader would crash on Adreno gpus when containing joint
logic. A separate shader without this code was created in order to
avoid this problem (perspectiveMatrixLightedShaderNoJoints.vert)

Even with this hack, on Vulkan the shaders fail to load on some devices with
Adreno CPUs. Another hack to avoid that issue, is to download the latest
Khronos validation layer binaries from
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers
and place the jniLibs directory in small3d\android\app\src\main.
small3d has been programmed to load them, even in release builds,
because for some strange reason this corrects the shader load issue
most of the time.
