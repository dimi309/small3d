   *            can be exported from Blender for example (see blender.org).
   *            From its menu, select File > Export > Wavefront (.obj). Then from the
   *            "Export OBJ" menu, only select "Write Normals", "Triangulate Faces" 
   *            and "Keep Vertex Order".
   *            The 3D model can also be constructed procedurally by code, by inserting
   *            values to the appropriate member variables.
