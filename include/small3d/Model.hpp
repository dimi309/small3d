   * @brief	A 3D model. It can be loaded from a Wavefront or glTF file.
   *            In the case of a Wavefront file, the format has to be somewhat specific,
   *            with triangulated faces and containing the normals. Such a file
   *            can be exported from Blender for example (see blender.org).
   *            From its menu, select File > Export > Wavefront (.obj). Then from the
   *            "Export OBJ" menu, only select "Write Normals", "Triangulate Faces" 
   *            and "Keep Vertex Order". Exporting .glb files is much simpler. Just do 
   *            so using the default options.
   *            The 3D model can also be constructed procedurally by code, by inserting
   *            values to the appropriate member variables.
